Introduction
============

Welcome to the ARRUS project documentation!

The name *ARRUS* is an abbreviation for *API for Research/Remote Ultrasound*.

The main objective of this project is to create a unified API that provides a
high-level local/remote interface for scalable ultrasound platforms and e.g.
simulation software. The common interface may help reduce the struggle when
experimenting with many different proprietary APIs, specific to hardware
for which they were prepared.

.. caution::

    We will do our best to maintain backward compatibility, but please note,
    that ARRUS is under development and its API may be modified
    in the future.
