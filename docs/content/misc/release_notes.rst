0.7.x
-----

0.7.7
.....

- Python API: Fixed classical beamforming RF data reordering for rx aperture < 64 elements, n_repeats > 1.


0.7.6
.....

- Python API: Now it should be possible to use arrus.devices.us4r.Us4r.set_tgc when arrus.ops.us4r.TxRxSequence is uploaded.

.....

- Python API: Fixed CUDA host memory unpinning on the arrus session close.

.....

0.7.3
.....

- core: Updated us4r-api to 0.8.7 (support multiple versions of US4RDBAR firmware).

0.7.2
.....

- Matlab API:

    - Removed the requirement of integer values for txNPeriods in MATLAB API.

0.7.1
.....

- core (C++):

    - us4R: Limited the range of available voltage to [5, 90] V.

0.7.0
.....

- core (C++):

    - Now it is possible to set how many times the TxRxSequence should be repeated: check TxRxSequence's nRepeats parameter. By default nRepeats is set to 1.
    - Because now it is possible to acquire batch of RF frame sequences (the nRepeats parameter was added), there were some breaking changes in the implementation of the FrameChannelMapping class. The getLogical method now returns three values: us4oem number, frame number and channel number. For each us4OEM module each frame number is counted from 0 (previously the each physical frame had consecutive numbers from 0 to n, where n is the total number of physical frames acquired by all us4OEM modules). To get the number of frames preceding a given us4OEM frame, use getFirstFrame method.
    - Now it is possible to turn on test AFE patterns, see Us4R::setTestPattern.
    - Now it is possible to remap the order of us4OEM modules numbering in the system configuration, see Us4RSettings, adapterToUs4RModuleNumber. By deafult identity mapping is used. 
    - Now it is possible to specify number of us4OEM modules the system is using, check Us4RSettings, nUs4OEMs parameter.
    - Implemented MANUAL scheme work mode, i.e. it is possible to trigger TX/RX sequence programatically, see Session::run method.
    - Added Us4R::{is,set}StopOnOverflow method, which gives the possibility to continue data acquisition even if the system has detected buffer overflow. By default this property is set to true, i.e. the system will stop on buffer overflow.
    - Added possibility to measure HV P and M voltage (see Us4R::{getVoltage, getMeasuredPVoltage, getMeasuredMVoltage). Supported only by the system with us4us HV hardware (e.g. HV256 or Us4RPSC). 

- Python API:

    - added n_repeats parameter to the simple TX/RX sequences available in ARRUS, the parameter allows to specify the number of times the sequence should be repeated ("batch size"),
    - arrus.utils.imaging reconstruction operators now requires that the input data are in the format (batch size, n TX, n RX, n samples),
    - arrus.utils.imaging.RxBeamformingImg is no longer available. Please use ReconstructLri + some form of compouding (e.g. Mean(axis=1)),

0.4.x
-----

0.4.6
`````

- MATLAB API:

    - Added parameter ``channelsMask`` to structure ``probe``. The parameter disables selected channels from Tx/Rx.
    - The list of Us4R class constructor parameters has been changed from list of positional \
      parameters to a list of pairs (name, value). E.g. use \
      ``Us4R('nArius', 2, 'voltage', 20, 'probeName', 'SL1543', 'adapterType', 'esaote3')``.
    - Added ``dynamicRange`` parameter to ``BModeDisplay`` class.
    - Temporarily, the maximum number of tx/rxs is limited to 2048.

0.4.5
`````

- MATLAB API:

    - Support for Esaote SP2430 has been added. The new probe is identified by ``SP2430``.

0.4.4
`````

- MATLAB API:

    - The Us4R constructor now requires the ``adapterType`` parameter to be \
      explicitly provided. Please check :ref:`arrus-Us4R` documentation.
    - Support for the new Esaote probes adapter has been added. The new Esaote \
      adapter is identified by the name ``'esaote2'``. The new adapter design \
      allows for wider rx aperture: 64 elements in a single tx/rx. \
      However, due to the adapter design, it may occur that a single rx channel \
      is connected to two probe elements in the rx aperture. \
      In this case, the second of the elements is switched off in the receive. \
      In the worst scenario, this workaround switches off 4 of 64 rx elements. \
      The size of the acquired rf data is unaffected.

0.4.3
`````

- Added signed drivers for Windows, changed driver name from
  ``ARIUS`` to ``us4OEM``.
  Check :ref:`arrus-installation` procedure for information on how to
  update drivers.

0.4.2
`````

- MATLAB API:

    - ``rxApertureCenter``, ``rxCenterElement``, and ``rxApertureSize`` parameters added \
      to control the rx aperture. Use them the same way as parameters for tx aperture control. \
      The rx aperture is now fully defined by those parameters and sequence type no longer affects it.
    - rx delay is set to zero to allow for shallow region imaging.
    - ``nRepetitions``: set it to "max" to acquire the maximum number of repetitions allowable.

0.4.1
`````

- MATLAB API:

    - ``nRepetitions`` parameter added to control the number of rf-data frames to be recorded.
    - ``rxDepthRange`` parameter added to control the starting & ending depth of recorded data.
    - ``rxNSamples`` parameter, if it is a 2-element vector, allows for the setting of the starting & ending \
      sample number for the recorded data. The 1-element option is still valid.

- Python API:

    - Created new API with a model of ``operations`` executed on available \
      devices.
    - Added ``fs_divider`` parameter to ``arrus.ops.Rx`` operation, which allows \
      to reduce the sampling frequency of the module.
    - Added asynchronous communication with the device using the ``arrus.ops.Loop`` \
      operation.
    - Added ``arrus.Us4OEMCfg`` parameter that turns on data transfer loggging \
      time.

0.4.0
`````

- MATLAB API:

    - Created a new version of the Matlab API (with STA and PWI sequences, for Esaote and Ultrasonix probes).
    - Added a simplified TGC control through tgcStart and tgcSlope parameters.
    - Added a classical linear scanning example (check :class:`arrus.LINSequence`).
    - From now on, txPri takes values in seconds (previously in [us]).

- Python API:

    - Simplified ``Us4OEM.set_tgc_samples`` - it now takes values from range \
      range [0, 1], where 0 means maximum gain, 1 means minimum gain
    - Added ``Us4OEM.set_active_channel_group``, which allows to choose which \
      groups of channels can be active.

-----

0.3.0
`````

- Added a function to set an rx/tx aperture mask - see Us4OEM.SetTxAperture(aperture) and Us4OEM.SetRxAperture(aperture)

-----

0.2.0
`````
- Added functions to trigger TX pulse asynchronously (Us4OEM.{TriggerStart, TriggerStop}).
- Added functions to enable/disable TGC and set TGC samples.
