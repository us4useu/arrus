The `Connection status` should be `Connected` (or something similar).

Then perform the following driver installation procedure:

1. Download and extract `arius-drivers-1290.zip <https://github.com/us4useu/arrus-public/releases/download/arius-drivers-1290/arius-drivers-1290.zip>`_ file,
   for example into ``C:\local\arius-drivers-1290\`` directory.
2. Disable driver signature enforcement on Windows 10:

    1. Click “start menu → Settings → Update and Security → Recovery →
       Restart now” under Advanced startup
    2. Press “Troubleshoot → Advanced options → Startup settings →
       Restart”
    3. After the computer restart a list of options should be presented.
       Press F7 to choose “Disable driver signature enforcement”.

3. Run ``C:\local\arius-drivers-1290\install.bat`` with **administrative
   privileges**. Confirm driver installation if necessary.
4. If your hardware is properly connected to the computer, a new ``PCI device``
   node should be visible in Windows Device Manager. Install drivers for the
   ``PCI Device`` using ``C:\local\arius-drivers-1290\drivers\arius.inf`` file.
