Check probe
===========

Sometimes some of the transducers in the probe can be damaged, e.g. mechanically.
Such a damaged transducer can be potentially dangerous to the system,
e.g. it can cause mismatched current flow in some subsystem and damage it.
This example consists of a python script (arrus/api/python/examples/check_probe.py)
evaluating transducers in ultrasound probe.
The evaluation is made on the basis of values of features
estimated from signals acquired by each transducer.
The transmit-receive scheme includes transmitting by single transducer
and receiving by transducers in aperture centered on the transmitter.
It is assumed that there are lens on transducers,
and the probe is *in the air*, thus the analysed signal 
comes from reflection at the lens-air interface.
Each transducer is excited by a short (single period) and low voltage (10V).


Current features
----------------

#. amplitude
#. pulse duration
#. energy of normalised signal
#. pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) with *footprint* signal
    PCC require a footprint (i.e. object containing reference rf signal array).
    The footprint should be acquired earlier using the same setup.
    This feature measure how much the signals changed comparing to footprint.
    When transducer is broken, the acquired signal should be different comparing
    to signal acquired before damage.


Methods of evaluation
---------------------

#. **Threshold**
    It bases on the values of features estimated
    from signals acquired from examined transducer.
    If the value is outside predefined range, the corresponding transducer is
    treated as *suspected*.
    These ranges can be set in FeatureDescriptor() calls 
    in the main() function of the script (below "# define features list").
    This ranges can differs between probes.

#. **Neighborhood**
    It bases on the values of features estimated
    from signals acquired from examined transducer and transducers
    in close neighborhood.
    If the value from the examined transducer differs
    from the values from other transducers by more then arbitrary percentage,
    the transducer is treated as *suspected*.
    Note, that PCC should be validated using threshold method
    (i.e. usign ByThresholdValidator()).


How to use the script
---------------------
The script is called from command line with some options.
At the end of its run, the scripts (optionally) display figures with values of
the features, and initial segments of signals from all transducer, for visual
evaluation.

Following options are accepted:

**required**::

--cfg_path: path to the system's configuration file,

**optional**::

    --help: displays help,
    --method: determines which method will be used - 'threshold' (default) or 'neighborhood',
    --rf_file: determines the name of optional output file with rf data,
    --display_frame: determines if script will display figures for visual evaluation,
    --n: the number of full Tx cycles to run (default 8),
    --tx_frequency: determines transmit frequency in [Hz] (default 8e6),
    --nrx: determines the size of receiving aperture (default 32),
    --create_footprint: creates footprint and store it in given pickle file,
    --use_footprint: determines which footprint file to use,
    --display_summary: displays features values on figure,
    --show_pulse_comparison: displays acquired pulse and corresponding footprint signal
    --features: features to evaluation (amplitude, energy, duration, pcc)

**Examples**::

    python check_probe.py --help
    python check_probe.py --cfg_path /home/user/us4r.prototxt
    python check_probe.py --cfg_path /home/user/us4r.prototxt --rf_file rf.pkl
    python check_probe.py --cfg_path ~/us4r.prototxt --create_footprint footprint.pkl --n=16
    python check_probe.py --cfg_path ~/us4r.prototxt --use_footprint footprint.pkl
    python check_probe.py --cfg_path ~/us4r.prototxt --use_footprint footprint.pkl --features amplitude pcc

**Additional notes:**

1. This script tries to identify channels it considers suspicious.
In the case of a suspicious channel, the user should verify it manually
(i.e. to look on the signal from the channel and decide, if it is good or not),
because the features used are only indicative.

2. Some features (like pulse duration) are more *sensitive* than the others,
i.e. are more likely to give false positives.
If there are a lot of false positives one can remove the feature from the list
of features to verify.

3. Using of threshold method assume that one know the range of values
of verified features.
These ranges often are different for different probes.
If one do not know the feature range of values, the neighborhood method can be used.

4. The use of probe footprint seems to be the most convenient, however it require
to create a footprint (using --create_footprint option).
It assume, that all channels are ok during footprint creation, and later it
just indentify channels where signals not match with the footprint.
Thus, when some channel is damaged during footprint creation, it may be undetected
on later tests.

5. Remember to set proper *tx_frequency* (using --tx_frequency) when create a footprint
or making tests without it
(when footprint is used, tx/rx scheme parameters will be taken from it).
