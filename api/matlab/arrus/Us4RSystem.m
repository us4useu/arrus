classdef (Abstract) Us4RSystem < handle
    % A handle to the Us4R system. 
    %
    % This class provides functions to configure the system and perform
    % data acquisition using the Us4R.

        function upload(obj, sequenceOperation, reconstructOperation)

            % Currently, only supports :class:`SimpleTxRxSequence`
            % and :class:`Reconstruction` implementations.

            % :returns: RF frame and reconstructed image \ 
			%   (if :class:`Reconstruction` operation was uploaded), \

            %
            % :param isContinue: should the system continue executing \
            %   the op? A function that takes no parameters and returns \
			%   a boolean value.
            % :param callback: a function to call after executing the \
            %   operation. Should take one parameter - the output of the \
            %   executed operation, e.g. raw RF data array (dimensions:  \
			%   (number of samples, number of channels, number of emissions)) \
			%   or b-mode image (height, width).
