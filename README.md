# ARRUS

API for Remote Research Ultrasound.

The name ARRUS is an abbreviation for API for Research/Remote Ultrasound.
The main objective of this project is to create a unified API that provides a high-level 
local/remote interface for scalable ultrasound platforms and e.g. simulation software. 
The common interface may help ease the process of experimenting with several 
proprietary APIs, each specific to the hardware for which they were prepared.
